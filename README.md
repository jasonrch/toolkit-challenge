# Notes
I created this application using MapKit for two reasons. One) Since my machine capabilities were limited, I had to use any tools that I was available to use. Since the Google Maps SDK and the Mapbox SDK are newer, in the sense that they both use the latest Swift compiler, I could not use either. I find that Mapbox SDK is the most powerful SDK for this project for it contains the heat map functionality that I needed for this project. I worked through this by using DTMHeatmap to input a heat map using MapKit. Also, the tile overlay installation would, in my opinion, been easier to implement.

Two) I figured that MapKit was the path of least resistance when it came to starting the project, given that the project was going to be native and written in SwiftUI.
